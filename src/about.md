\- [Collins dictionary][]

In this case, a website called `developer.com` or something like it would be a strident, one-dimensional lie.
It would imply that the content is either all written from a developer perspective or to a developer audience.
This is not the hope.

The hope is to write on both technical and non-technical topics.
The hope is to publish regularly.
The hope is to rekindle some of the joy and charm of the unselfconscious early 2000s internet, appealing to the better angels of its nature.

### Long version

The name of this site comes from the fact that, in the summer of 2020, a covid bubble adopted a small deer-head chihuahua / italian greyhound mix puppy.
This puppy constantly snapped at the people in her bubble.
She was just a chihuahua in a bubble, fool.

In any case, her dolichocephaly and propensity for snapping at passersby earned her a notorious reputation.
Well-founded allegations of unfounded alligations were leveled against her, and she was found guilty in due course of electing herself judge, jury, and alligator.
But this represented an issue, phylogenetically and terminologically.
Despite the morphological and behavioral evidence, she did not meet the admission criteria to be properly called an alligator in her own right.
On appeal she was found guilty only of engaging in crocodilianity.
Crocodilianity being a lesser crime, she was suffered to live.

After awhile, calling her "crocodilian" turned out to be a gateway prefix.
Other prefixes had \-dilian affixed to them.
Tremulously at first, and then with mounting heat and passion because it proved incredibly facile.
Mostly to water-down definitions.
Watered-down definitions are often useful in real life, because they are more fun.
Ambiguity is the essence of wordplay.

And so, this site is devoted to the developerdilian.
One who may or may not actually be a developer, but exists in the larger class of people within which developers also exist.
That kind of person.

If you are that kind of person, welcome.
