\- [Collins dictionary][]

In this case, a website called `developer.com` or something like it would be a strident, one-dimensional lie.
It would imply that the content is either all written from a developer perspective or to a developer audience.
This is not the hope.

The hope is to write on both technical and non-technical topics.
The hope is to publish regularly.
The hope is to rekindle some of the joy and charm of the unselfconscious early 2000s internet, appealing to the better angels of its nature.
