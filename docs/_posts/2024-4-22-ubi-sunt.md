The internet was all a-flutter this week when a human jawbone was found in some travertine marble from many thousands of years ago.
Regardless of whether this story is true, it reminds us of our place in the natural order of things.

We spend our entire lives filled with hot saltwater, and it's important for us to precipitate a fair bit of it into calcareous substrate so we aren't just formless bags of hot saltwater.
We eat rocks to make more rocks, coral reefs inside our bodies.
Our saltwater sojourn involves pilfering this mana away from other living things.
The lifecycle of any organism can be viewed through the lens of a spree of saltwater banditry.

[Anyway][discourse marker], here's a poem about that.

## Living Fossils

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.\\
But we are not dust, nor ashes.\\
We are brine and stone.\\
When we are wounded, the salt of our brine stains the world. The rocks that give use structure, fracture.\\
Our brine returns to the brine of the world.\\
Our stones return to the stones.

We are an ocean planet, and we bring the earth and sea with us wherever we go.
